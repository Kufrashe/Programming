"""
    The Purpose of this algorithm is to create a custom and simplified version of a neural network that can be used
    in Machine Learning and Processes alike. This type of Algorithm Design I like to call, "Kufrashe_Style_Algorithms."
    Please note that these algorithms are developed according to my understanding of Machine Learning and AI.
    
    These algorithms of mine are mainly centered on the theory which l have, and are as of time of development, 
    (which is 13 March 2024), mainly directed towards AI Development and Machine Learning.
    
    Now the following is the theory of how this is going to go about, And how my AI algorithms will process data 
    using neural networks that are customly developed by your trully "Kudakwashe G Mazikana | Kufrashe |Kufrashe 
    Technologies ". This is how it goes:

        (a) -> The Network can take inputs such as numbers or an equation or string.
        (b) -> Creates data_processing_points based on the size/magnitude of the input data;
        (b) -> The data is processed but not fully.
        (c) -> The data passes through the MAINS_Processing_Point then on to the Secondary_Processing_Points;
        (c) -> The Secondary_Processing_Points process the data for an analysis and also to a form which can be;
                understood by the developer or programmers.
        (c) -> The Data which has been processed starts gets processed at the information_point where our data;
                is put into a form understandable by the majority of people.
        (c) -> The output_point then finally displays the data so that it is ready to be visualized, documented or;
                even be used for decision making and evaluation or analysis situations.
